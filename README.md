Installing IPython Notebook <br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ <br />
$ sudo apt-get install ipython-notebook python-matplotlib <br />
Or <br />
if you want to install using 'pip', then you can install IPython as follows. <br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ <br />
$ pip install ipython[notebook] <br />

Starting IPython <br />

To start IPython in terminal: <br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ <br />
$ ipython Sequential_Learning_for_Multi_Channel_Wireless_Network_Monitoring_With_Channel_Switching_Costs.ipynb <br />

or  <br />

jupyter Sequential_Learning_for_Multi_Channel_Wireless_Network_Monitoring_With_Channel_Switching_Costs.ipynb <br />

Once IPython is running sucessfully, a browser window will automatically open or <br />
point your web browser at http://localhost:8888 to start using IPython notebooks. <br />

Brief Description: <br />

Accurate and timely estimates of wireless network conditions and performance characteristics can yield better performance
in a number of applications such as network resource management,wireless advisory,troubleshooting etc.
However,utilization of multiple contiguous or non-contiguous channels or bands for estimation gives rise to 
the Sniffer-channel assignment problem.Sniffer-channel assignment with no prior knowledge of user activity is closely related
to the multi-armed bandit problem (MAB) which can be optimized by Sequential Learning. While prior works have explored ways to use variants
of the Upper Confidence Bound(UCB) algorithm for this purpose, they have assumed the users are static.
We analyze two algorithms: the discounted UCB and the sliding-window UCB to cater to the wireless network 
with non-stationary users i.e mobile users.
